# Project Description
This project focuses on building a logistic regression model to classify breast cancer tumors based on various features. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, the model distinguishes between malignant and benign tumors. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, providing insights into the effectiveness of logistic regression for binary classification tasks in healthcare. Through this analysis, we aim to contribute to early detection methods for breast cancer, highlighting the importance of accurate predictive modeling in medical diagnostics.
